Build a fully animated, cyber-aesthetic, Gen-Z dark rave themed personal portfolio website for me using the following tech stack: Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Three.js + GSAP + Barba.js + Framer Motion. Code must be clean, modular, reusable, production-ready, and error-free. Do not explain anything — only provide full implementation with all files, folders, and code.

GOAL:
Create a highly interactive, unique, dark rave / cyberpunk Gen-Z portfolio with heavy focus on motion design, micro-interactions, and 3D visuals. Everything should feel like a futuristic rave OS — neon, glitchy, fluid, and smooth.

TECH & LIBRARIES (MANDATORY):

Next.js 14 (App Router)

TypeScript

TailwindCSS

Three.js (3D scenes, background, particles)

GSAP (scroll + micro animations)

Barba.js (page transitions)

Framer Motion (component-level transitions if helpful)

THEME & VISUAL LANGUAGE:

Base: pure black / deep charcoal background

Neon rave colors: electric blue, cyan, magenta, purple, acid green accents

Use glow: box-shadow + text-shadow to simulate neon tubes

VHS / glitch micro animations on hover or during transitions

Add subtle grain / noise overlay for gritty rave feel

Use gradients like: radial neon glows and angular gradient borders

GLOBAL EXPERIENCE FEATURES (IMPORTANT):

Custom Cursor System:

Replace default cursor with:

Small central dot

Larger blurred outer circle that follows with slight delay (GSAP)

On hover over interactive elements (links, buttons, project cards), cursor grows, changes color, or shows label text (e.g., “View”, “Open”, “Play”).

Page Transitions (Barba.js):

All page changes must have a transition using Barba.js.

Style:

Rave-like screen wipe, glitch line, or expanding neon circle.

Combine opacity + scale + slight RGB separation.

Preloader / Intro Screen:

On first load, show a rave-style intro:

Animated logo or my initials (“HP”) with neon stroke + glow.

Quick glitch text: “Booting RaveOS…”, “Loading Portfolio…”.

Use GSAP timeline for preloader animation and then transition into Home page content.

Sound / Audio Reactive Option (Optional but add hooks):

Add a toggle button in the UI (e.g., “AUDIO MODE”).

When enabled, make background visualizers react subtly to a dummy audio track or simple pseudo-random beat simulation (no need for full audio player; pseudo-react is fine).

Keep sound off by default.

SITE STRUCTURE / PAGES:

PAGES: Home, About, Projects, Contact (all using App Router in app/)

HOME PAGE:

Fullscreen hero with Three.js scene:

Neon particles, energy waves, or wireframe sphere.

Rotate/move slightly with mouse movement (parallax feel).

Animated intro text:

Use GSAP split text effect: stagger each word/letter entrance.

Short tagline and CTA buttons:

“View Projects”, “Contact Me” buttons with magnetic hover (button moves slightly towards cursor).

Background accent:

Add diagonal neon grid or wave-like lines behind the hero.

ABOUT PAGE:
Sections:

Hero strip:

Neon framed profile image (circular or rounded card with glow).

Name + Role + animated typewriter-like subtitle.

Skills Area:

Skill chips/pills arranged in a fluid layout.

On hover: pill slightly scales, glows, and jitters very slightly.

Timeline Area (Education + Experience):

Vertical or horizontal timeline with neon connectors.

Scroll-triggered reveal of each card using GSAP.

PROJECTS PAGE:

Project Filter Bar:

Tabs or buttons for categories (e.g., “All”, “Web”, “3D”, “Experimental”).

Filter animation: when changing category, project cards animate out and back in with stagger using GSAP or Framer Motion.

Project Cards:

3D tilt-on-hover effect (using CSS + JS/Framer Motion).

Each card shows: title, short description, tech stack tags, CTA (“Live”, “Code”).

Project Detail (Modal or Subpage):

On click, open a modal or route to dynamic page /projects/[slug].

Include hero image banner, role, tech used, features list, and links.

CONTACT PAGE:

Contact Form:

Name, Email, Message fields.

Neon inputs with focus glow.

Submit button with strong hover animation (scale + glow pulse).

Background:

Three.js floating spheres or blobs, slowly moving.

Social Links Bar:

GitHub, LinkedIn, Email icons.

On hover: icon emits glow ring or glitch flicker.

LAYOUT & COMPONENT STRUCTURE:
Use this structure (or improved, but keep it clear):

app/layout.tsx (root layout with global providers, fonts, Barba.js integration wrapper if needed)

app/page.tsx (Home)

app/about/page.tsx

app/projects/page.tsx

app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx (dynamic project details)

app/contact/page.tsx

Components (place in components/):

components/layout/Navbar.tsx

components/layout/Footer.tsx

components/layout/PageTransition.tsx (can wrap content for Framer Motion + Barba or GSAP)

components/ui/Button.tsx

components/ui/SectionTitle.tsx

components/ui/SkillChip.tsx

components/ui/TimelineItem.tsx

components/ui/ProjectCard.tsx

components/ui/Preloader.tsx

components/ui/CustomCursor.tsx

components/forms/ContactForm.tsx

components/3d/HeroScene.tsx

components/3d/FloatingSpheres.tsx

UTILS & STYLES:

lib/utils.ts for helper functions (e.g., cn/classNames).

tailwind.config.ts with extended theme:

Custom colors: neonBlue, neonPink, neonPurple, neonCyan, neonGreen.

Box shadows: neonGlow variants.

styles/globals.css:

Global resets, custom scrollbar, grain/noise overlay, body background.

ANIMATION DETAILS:

Use GSAP’s ScrollTrigger for scroll-based animations (section reveals, timelines, staggered cards).

Use GSAP timelines for:

Preloader

Hero entrance

Stagger loading of navbar links and primary CTAs.

Use Framer Motion for simple mounting/unmounting (fade/slide) inside pages and modals.

Make sure animations are performance-aware (no crazy heavy loops, reuse canvases).

BARBA.JS INTEGRATION:

Integrate Barba.js to handle page/view transitions.

On route change:

Animate old page out (fade/glitch).

Animate new page in (scale-up + fade + glow swipe).

RESPONSIVENESS:

Desktop: multi-column, breathing space, large type.

Tablet: stacked sections.

Mobile: single-column, simplified animations but still present (no breaking).

Use proper semantic HTML tags.

Alt text on images.

Meta tags in head (title, description) for each main page.
